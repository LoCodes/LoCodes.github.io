Instruction for LasVegasHikes Repository 


This CLI Application shows 5 top rated Hike trails around  the Las Vegas Valley. You will be able to interact with this app and is able to show you information on the option you wish to choose. Information such as estimated time of the trail length by kilometers, hike elevation, difficulty level,  etc. 

Read the README, there will be a video link to showcase how it works. 


Clone the link of repository on your ide

Make sure you are in the right folder if not type in your terminal: 

cd LasVegasHikes 

 ./bin/console  

or 

 bin/run 

May  be prompted to run 'bunldle install' 

After installing all gems, you may now run bin/run or ./bin/console to start CLI.


CLI will show you a list of the trails, you may choose which trail you'd like information on from 1-5, type "list" to see the list again, or simply "exit" when done. 

CLI will exit you out automatically when invalid key or keyword is entered, and you will be asked to try again. 


Hope you enjoy this simple yet tedious(for me) cli project.
