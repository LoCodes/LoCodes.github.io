 The data structures that is in programming languages are extremely similar to rules and/or regulaltion of a real-world system that we use outside of software field. I see it as a policy and procedure in a healthcare enovironment for example. All hospitals have Policy and Procedure for every task, and the policy and procedure of a specific surgery would not be the same policy and procedure as a check-up with your primary doctor.  To be able to successfully and safely execute each jobs, one must follow the policy and procedure as follows. Just like in programming, in real-life there are some techniques to successfully finish the task, in specific order or else your patient's life might be in great danger in a hands of a surgeon. In our case as programmers it is more on the policy and procedure for a check-up for a primary doctor, there will be the core tasks that one must abide, but in some cases some tasks can be done in diffrent order. Although, in programming  we get errors,  guidelines, and seconds, third, or twentieth try to attempt to get to the end goal. In the healthcare or even most real-world job not so much.
