Feeling stuck and I don't mean only physically.  I am a "homebody", one may call it. So feeling stuck is more beneathe the surface.  Along with the crisis that is going on around all of us, I'd like to say I hope everyone is staying safe and sane.  To those who are not used to being at home, this blog post is dedicated for you. I  have accumulated and thought thoroughly of activities and ideas one may consider of doing when there is literally nothing else you can think of, or even to keep things interesting for you at home.  I know you are probably thinking,  "That's easy,  just study to fill your time".  While this should be one of our major priorities, we all know that we can't all sit here in one place nor is it healthy.  Most of us are also working from home for the time being as well and it can be tedious to stare at a screen all day right?  So here is a covid-19 friendly list for everyone to keep a healthier balance of life, as we go through this pandemic together.
