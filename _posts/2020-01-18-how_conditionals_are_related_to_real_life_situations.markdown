A conditional is a fork (or many forks) in the road. Your data approaches a conditional and the conditional then tells the data where to go based on some defined parameters. Conditionals are formed using a combination of if statements and comparison and logical operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &&, ||). They are basic logical structures that are defined with the reserved words if, else, elsif, and end. Note that elsif is missing an "e". Enough talking, time to code.The content of your blog post goes here.


A conditional in ruby is one of the most relatable to real life situations. For instance, in Shark Tank (show), is a prime example of when a conditional is constantly being used, or in a business agreement. In the show Shark Tank, a business owner presents their product and do his/her pitch towards the "Sharks".  The sharks then throws an offer to that the business person IF they like what they see. The sharks can either say no to their presentention, if one of the sharks make an offer, the person presenting then decides or try to meet the shark in the middle. IF NOT this offer, he/she can take a different offer that eventually works for him/her. 

Just like in conditionals, this too can go on and on until you get the right one that you are looking for.
